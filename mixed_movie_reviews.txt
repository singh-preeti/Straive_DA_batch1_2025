The movie had stunning visuals but the story felt weak and predictable.
Absolutely loved the performances, the cast was brilliant and emotional.
The film was too long and dragged in the middle, I almost fell asleep.
Great soundtrack and direction, really kept me engaged throughout.
Disappointing ending, it felt rushed and unsatisfying.
An inspiring and heartwarming story, I left the theater smiling.
Terrible dialogue and bad acting, one of the worst movies this year.
A masterpiece of storytelling, every scene had depth and meaning.
Mediocre at best, nothing special and easily forgettable.
Fantastic action sequences and great pacing, I would watch again.
The characters lacked development, I couldnâ€™t connect with them.
A visually beautiful film with strong performances and a moving plot.
The jokes fell flat, and the humor felt forced.
A powerful message delivered with elegance and emotional weight.
Weak screenplay and confusing plot twists ruined the experience.
One of the best movies of the decade, an instant classic.
Poor editing and unnecessary scenes made it boring.
The chemistry between the leads was amazing, very believable.
Predictable storyline with no surprises, very disappointing.
A rollercoaster of emotions, I laughed, cried, and cheered.
